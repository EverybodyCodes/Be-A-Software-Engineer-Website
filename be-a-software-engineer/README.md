  Be A Software Engineer Website
</h1>

This is a public website meant to inspire people everywhere to be software engineers, share information about how to be a great coder, and end poverty everywhere.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1.  **Install Deps**

    we recommend using the node version in .nvmrc
    ```
    nvm use
    ```

    then install deps:

    ```
    npm i
    ```

    you may need to install gatsby first
    ```
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

2.  **Run Tests**

    Run Unit Tests

    ```shell
    npm test
    ```

3.  **Run In Local Browser**


    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Open the source code and start editing. Site updates in real-time as you edit the code!

    The site runs at: http://localhost:8000

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. !

4. **Deploying**

   - when code is pushed to a branch that begins with the word "feature", a pipeline build kicks off. If pipeline succeeds, code in the ci branch is deployed to a _ci_ environment.

   - PRs should be opened from feature branch to merge into develop branch. When code is merged into develop, code in deploy is deployed to a _dev_ environment.

## üßê Some Gatsby-Specific Files

- **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

- **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

- **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

-  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
